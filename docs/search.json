This is the definition of neutral evolution!\nBut if the model is not neutral, an individual’s chance of death (or ability to survive in its environment) is based on its ability to compete with other individuals and survive in its environment.\nThe closer the trait of the individual is to the environmental optimum of 1, a perfect match to its environment, the more likely it is to survive.\nBut at the same time, the more individuals that have similar traits to it, the more the resources each needs will overlap, and this competition will make it harder to survive. (Add more on theory here).\nAn outcome of RoLE’s individual-based model framework is that intraspecific competition is modeled, and even emphasized. Since individuals of the same species typically have similar traits, they will compete more. (could add info on what comp and env sigma do, but this info might belong in parameters section)."
