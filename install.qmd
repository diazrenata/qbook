# Installation

## Compiled binaries

We recommend installing our pre-compiled binaries from r-universe.

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages('roleR', repos = c('https://role-model.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## From source

You can also install from source from our GitHub repository, but it is not recommended.

```{r eval=FALSE}

library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("role-model/roleR",dependencies=TRUE)
```
