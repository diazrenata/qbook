# Model inputs: Setting the stage

Having just explored the components of the model, we will now review the input parameters that "set the stage" by defining both how these components are initialized and how they change over the course of the simulation.

We will also review the default configurations of parameters available in roleR and their meanings and assumptions.

## Community shape & initialization params

individuals_local

individuals_meta

species_meta

init_type

## Birth vs. dispersal param

dispersal_prob

## Speciation and extinction params

speciation_local

speciation_meta

extinction_meta

## Traits, filtering, and competition params

trait_sigma

env_sigma

comp_sigma

## Genetics params

mutation_rate

num_basepairs

## Meta params

niter

niterTimestep

## Pre-set configurations
